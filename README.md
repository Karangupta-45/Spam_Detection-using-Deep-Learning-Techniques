# Spam_Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
In this project A dataset from the UCL has been used containing the Ham and Spam message collection.
In this project in order to Detect the spam and ham messages deep learning techniques have been used.
Bi-LSTM, LSTM and Dense text classifier are the deep learning techniques used in this spam detection project.
After conducting extensive research into each of the three algorithms in order to determine which one is most effective for the detection of SMS spam, we came to the conclusion that the Bidirectional LSTM algorithm is the one that provides the highest level of accuracy when compared to the LSTM algorithm, the Bidirectional LSTM algorithm, and the dense text classifier.
